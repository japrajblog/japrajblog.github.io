          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <p>Max (red) wakes up one morning and sees a meteorite flying over his house. He wakes up his friends Rex (blue) and Zoe(pink) and they head to a forest to see where it landed. As they arrive to a forest, they find three rocks on the ground, Max picks up a rock with a symbol of lightning, Rex picks up a rock with a symbol of wind, and Zoe picks up a rock with a symbol of a tree. Max does something with his rock and somehow summons a big Triceratops. After messing around with the rock, he turns the Triceratops into a baby. Then the show cuts into a gladiator arena where a huge amount of dinosaurs. A crazy scientist known as Dr. Z exclaims that he wants to become the king of all dinosaurs. Then out of nowhere, he gets chased down by a t-rex and runs away from it until the t-rex becomes a baby. Dr. Z’s son, Seth, comes down and talks about how their special machine can not be built until they get the necessary parts. Next, the show returns to the kids and they are talking to their father who does not believe them about what happened until Max uses his card a second time. Max’s father takes the stones from the children and goes to his lab. He then explains that the three stones are only a small part of a missing relic which holds a great power. Next, Max goes to the beach with his baby triceratops and a giant t-rex starts chasing it. His father saves the day by giving Max a device to turn his baby triceratops into a fully grown one. The triceratops and T-rex fight and once the Triceratops (named Chomp) wins, a group of Dr. Z’s lackeys show up to take away the T-rex. At the end, Zoe and Rexa also receive special devices to help them communicate with their cards.</p>

          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>- I tried a movie called ‘Coco’ and a show called ‘Call My Agent!’ but I could not keep up with the rate of speaking without subtitles.
            <br>- After searching for childrens tv shows, I found a list of shows that I could try http://frenglishlearning.com/french-shows-kids-netflix/
            <br>- I decided to try the show ‘Dinosaur King’ because it had the highest recommended age (ages 9+)
            <br>- After watching for about 5 minutes, I only got one new word which was actually part of the episode’s title, I decided to use french subtitles so that I could see how words are spelled. Another reason for this was because I could only understand about 50% of what was being said which was annoying me because it made the show seem even slower.
            <br>- One thing I had to learn was how to type french accents on my computer for my notes so I found a list of keyboard shortcuts and copied it to my notes in google drive
            <br>- I found myself pausing the show a lot to write down new words and search up their meaning, a 20 minute episode took me more than an hour to go through. I did the whole thing in one day because I started on it late, but next week, I will split it up over the period of a week.
            <br>- By the end of the episode, I realized that I had been more focused on reading the subtitles than actually listening to what was going on, so I will try to keep this in mind for next week and try to rely less on the subtitles
            <br>- I had a huge list of new words by the end and I want to try using some of them in my writing so I will write down the words that seem to be the most appropriate (leave out words such as meteor but write down words like ‘Manque [a shortage of])
            <br>- Next week, I might try a new show because I found this one to be quite boring
