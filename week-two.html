					<h2>Summary</h2>
					<p>Starts with two men in a bunker while it snows outside. Man1 prods Man2 to talk about his life as he has only said three things in the past 5 years that they've been in the bunker. Man1 asks man2 why he is in the bunker and man2 gives a generic answer so man1 begins telling his own tale in order to create some trust with man2. Then there is jump to the past, Man1 sits in front of a computer from which he could see through the eyes of a client. His client has some sort of eye implant which broadcasts everything to man1’s computer. Man1 helps his client chose clothes and then after his client arrives to a party, helps him get a girl by telling him what to say and do. After some time, the girl goes to the bathroom and the client starts talking to man1 through his mic. The girl walks in on him and thinks that they are similar because they could both hear ghosts / voices. She invites him to her house and once they arrive, she puts drugs in his drink and forces him to commit suicide with her because she thought that like herself, he was tired of life (he was trying to find similarities between them to get her interested and said some things such as ‘this is just a transition’ which she took to heart). Man1 at that point ended his career of helping guys get girls but as he was leaving the house to dispose of any evidence that he was involved with his client’s death, his wife came out and ended things with him once she found out. At this point, she ‘blocks’ him, which means that she activates a feature on her eye implants which allows her to wipe him out from her life/not see him at all and man1 can no longer see her either. After man1 has finished telling his story, man2 begins to guess what man1 actually did for a living. Man1 tells a story of a regular day at his job. Then it cuts to a woman sitting in a hospital bed, waiting for surgery. During the surgery, we see a chip being removed from her head and being placed in a small device. The woman’s consciousness was stored in the chip. Next, man1 explains that his job is to explain to the woman her new life as a house control device. He says that the chip is actually a copy of her consciousness and that she paid to get a copy of herself to control her house (smart/computer controlled house). Part of man1’s job is to convince the chiplady to accept her new life as a house control device, he demonstrates her job by getting her to grill some toast and when she says that she does not wish to live like that, he speeds up her perception of time and forces her to live through 3 weeks, and then 6 months, of nothing / sitting in the house device. Now, she says that she will do anything to keep herself occupied.

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Only going to write down about 20 new words, I would rather have fewer words that I actually remember and could use in my writing than a big list of words that I don’t remember at all. I am going to try to use a few of my new words in the next project. I decided to not watch the same show as last time because I found it very boring, I watched an episode of Black Mirror called White Christmas. Used subtitles again (French, not English) as I could not keep up with the rate of speaking. Since I was pausing a lot last week and it took me an hour to get through a twenty minute episode, I tried to pause the show less frequently so that I could get through it faster. One thing I noticed was that people speak very quickly and kind of in bursts/without pausing and their words blend together. Also, they express themselves by pausing / saying a word more slowly. The word aurais is a form of avoir, it means ‘would’ but it is used differently to most verbs so I will not be using it. I decided to split up the episode over two weeks, I spent two hours just watching half of it, the episode was about an hour twenty minutes. This time was spent pausing the show to record reflections, to search up new words, and to rewatch parts of the show to understand what was said. Some things I learned are that  instead of emploi, the word ‘job’ was used (emploi = job). Also, I saw the imperative, passe compose, and reflexive verbs being used in a lot of cases.
