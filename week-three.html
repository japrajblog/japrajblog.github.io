					<h2>Summary</h2>
					<p>Returns to the bunker, man2 begins telling the story of his life. Begins with stating that his wife’s father never liked him. Man2 and his wife are heading out to a bar and shows that they are very happy. After the bar, they transition into a house party, there is some tension between the wife and one of the guests. After the party is over, man2’s wife says that she feels sick / under the weather and as man2 is cleaning up, he finds a pregnancy test which says positive. The wife says she does not wish to have the baby. Man2 finds this unacceptable and he wishes to have the baby. After trying to convince her, he starts an argument which ends with the wife ‘blocking’ him. Blocking means that she cannot see him at all and he cannot see her. After this, she drives away and a few months, he sees her again and we see that she decided to keep the baby (her stomach is larger). After man2 tries to grab her and get her to unblock him, she files a restraining order which means that he cannot be within 10 miles of her. Man2 tries writing several letters to his wife but he never received a reply. He remembered that his wife always visited her father during the winter so he went to his father’s house and saw that she had given birth to a child. Since he was blocked, he could not see his wife’s child either. Man2 returns to the father’s cottage every year and even begins leaving presents for his daughter. One day while he was watching the news, man2 saw that his wife had died in an accident. He returned to the cottage and can finally see his daughter. When he gets a good look at her face, it turns out that she is chinese (neither man2 nor his wife were chinese meaning that his wife had cheated). He follows his ‘daughter’ into the house and sees his wife’s father who tries to get man2 to leave by threatening him with a knife. Man2 punches the old man resulting in him dying.  During the story, the clock in the cottage rings and man2 points out that the clock in the cottage is the same as the one in the bunker. Next, man2 continues with his story, stating that he was locked into a prison but he never confessed to the murder. Man1 asks what happened to the little girl and man2 states that he left the cottage, leaving the little girl to die all alone in the cottage during a snowstorm. Now, back at the bunker, man1 rejoices, stating that he has finally finished his job. We then see man1 waking up from a simulation where he had sped up time several times, as shown in his job. Man2 is sitting in a cell, locked up and an officer tells him that he is going to stay in prison for a long time. The officer says that man1 is now free to leave prison for his crime as well because he helped them capture so many criminals. However, there is one condition to his freedom: he is going to be ‘blocked’ from the entire world. We then see man1 stepping out of the station and walking into a crowd of people. We are shown his perspective and all we see is a huge amount of gray blobs walking around. Finally, the episode ends with an officer changing the setting on the bunker to go through 1000 years per minute, speeding up man2’s perception of time and making him go insane.</p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Today, I continued to watch Black Mirror: White Christmas. I noticed that when saying ‘parfait’, they pronounced the ‘T’ at the end, instead of pronouncing it ‘parfay’, they said it like ‘parfete’ however, when I googled it, it turns out that this is incorrect. Saw some reflexive verbs being used, for example, ‘ne me touchez pas’. I think typing out the words helps me remember them, so I used them in sentences to practice. I noticed that ‘ne’ is said super quick, instead of ‘je ne peux pas’, it sounds like ‘je peux pas’. Also, instead of saying ‘Oui’ like ‘we’, it is pronounced ‘whey’ Also, there was an instance of food being described with adjectives which were conjugated in the past tense and I thought it was pretty cool to see it immediately being used since we learned it in class recently. Another thing I learned is that the word for ‘versus’ is ‘contre’, so instead of ‘vs.’, the abbreviation ‘c.’ is used. I tried to only note down words which could be useful in a conversation, but I think that it would be very difficult to actually remember their meanings unless I note them down and try to use them during conversation, but I think that if I were to see one of these words being used, I could probably figure out its meaning.</p>
